Time signature: 
4/4 , 3/4 etc

Starting note: Tonic 
Ending note: Tonic 

- A-C structure: 3 part, 2 part.
  - Each part is 4 bars.
  - 2 part: Resolution occurs in 2 parts (almost no melody is like that?)
  - 3 part: Resolution occurs in 3 parts (or 12 bars, twinkle twinkle)
  - 4 part: Resolution occurs in 3 parts (or 16 bars, row row row your
    boat)
  
- A-C structure: (3 part A-C structure)

  - 3 part AC structure: with third part same as first part
    - Any line that ends with a tonic is the ending of the first part

  - 3 part AC structure: no note rhythm changes, and
    - System takes a rhythm change as a new composition

  - 3 part AC structure: both parts of the second part are identical
    - segment that is identical to the previous 8 bars.

  - 3 part AC structure: 3-4,7-8 is a transpose up by a certain
    amount, 7-8,11-12 is tranpose down by same amount.

- A-C structure recognition and output for every 2bars 
  
  - Controls: 
    - N:0
    - n:2
    - t:2

  - function (rhythmic structure (2q,2q,2q,1h), scale (to be more consistent))
    
  - 1-2 bars: 
    - No input yet
    - Conditions:
      - Ending note is the tonic
      - No of input segments > 8
      - No of segments - 8 is identical to input 

    - output: 1) repeat rhythmic structure of input 
      2) pick a number "3n" that is within octave 
      3) create two pairs of quarter notes, 3n, 2n, n descending to
         tonic by a tone
      4) End with the tonic, half note.

  - 3-4 bars
    - Ending note of the last input is not a tonic,
    - Beginning note of the last input is a tonic 
    - No of input segments !> 8
    - No of segments - 8 is not identical 

    - Output: 1) pick a transpose number (t:control) 
      2) every note of current input + t  

  - 5-6 bars 
    - Ending of the input is a tonic 
    - Beginning note is not a tonic 
    - No of input segments !> 11
    - Last input and No of segments - 8 are not identical 
    
    - Output: Repeat  
      
  - 7-8 bars 
    - segment whose every note is a tranpose of the previous input
      segment (the last 8 notes)

    - Output: Repeat input from -6 bars

  - 9-10 bars 
    - Every note of last input is identical to every note of last-last
      input

    - Output: Repeat input from -6 bars 

  - 11-12 bars (Start a new melody)
    - Beginning note of the last input is tonic
    - Ending note is not a tonic
    - No of input segments > 8
    - No of segments - 8 is identical to input 

    - Output: 1) pick a Note "N" randomly from 12 (that's it!)
      2) (2Q"N" -up- 2Q"N+7" -up- 2Q"N+9" -down- 1H"N+7")
